Introduction to  tytpescript with MayanWolf on twitch https://www.twitch.tv/mayanwolfe
In this session, we covered several topics related to software development and programming. We discussed TypeScript, string interpolation, and function syntax, type aliases, and interfaces,using enums to define a set of named constants, and using the const keyword to define a constant value.

TypeScript
TypeScript is a programming language that is a superset of JavaScript. It adds optional static typing, classes, and interfaces to JavaScript. This makes the code more reliable, maintainable, and easier to read.

To use TypeScript, you need to install the TypeScript compiler on your computer, which can be done using npm (the Node Package Manager). Once installed, you can create .ts files, write TypeScript code, and compile it to JavaScript using the tsc command.
